         <h3 >Experience</h3><br>
         <p >Michael has a previous part-time job as a data entry at DSWD - listahanan during his 3rd yr. college.   
         <br>He has no experience yet in the industry in related to programming. 
         <br>The biggest school project he had experienced so far was his intern at PNP Crime Laboratory Region XI known as SOCO along with his group mates.
         <br>SOCO used paper to process their data in their 5 divisions and the goal of our team in the project was to automated their data process. 
         <br>Michael was the back-end of the project but unfortunately his the only one can code that much so he did most of the work.
         <br>The project uses html, css, javascript, jquery , mysql and php.
         <br>We use php here as the decision of the group.
         <br>The system is called PNP Crime Lab Region XI Information System
         <br>Unfortunately the system was not implement and deploy because the soco has a new nationwide online system based on manila.
         <br>Sample screenshoots of the System:
